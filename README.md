# Yttrium-Terminus

Yttrium Terminus is an organization consisting of a varying number of students that strive to make FOSS-ish packages and applications. All software is free of charge and most likely open source.

The organization was made to help contribute to the Yttrius Project, which is a OOP based language consisting of many different packages. Although the original Yttrius Product only included the Y++ Compiler, it now has expanded to the following packages:
- Y++22
- Yttrius-Exon AI Pathfinding Engine
- Yttrius-CLI scripting for \*NIX systems
- YttriusSDK-IDE for Yttrius Tools
- YMake-A semi like clone of the CMake Engine to be compatible for the Y++ Compiler and build tools
- Ye-(Yttrius Elixium) A bridge between Elixir and Yttrius
- Y++Transpiler-The main way bundled with the YttriusSDK to fetch objects between every other language in the Yttrius family
- YTT-The standard GUI look for YttriusSDKIDE

However, there are also other projects:
- JLibXX-Extension of the JavaLibrary
- YttriusAPI-WASM API for the Yttrius Protocol
- Discord Code Bot-Execute via Discord through a Discord Bot
- YttriusSource-A Discord Bot written in JavaScript
- Yttrius-Not to be confused with the other Yttrius, but this is a Discord Bot using yAPI and Y++ for general purpose utils
